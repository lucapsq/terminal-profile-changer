## Getting started


### Installation

First of all download the full repository using the command:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lucapsq/terminal-profile-changer.git
```

Then we open the new folder:
```sh
cd terminal-profile-changer
```

To start the script you only need to run this command:
```sh
./main.sh
```
The only thing left to do is to follow the launched script and enter the desired profile.


### Usage

With this script you can decide whether to install/reinstall a specific profile configuration, or remove all files and changes you have made, this choice is made when the script is started.


## Credits
For this script I have to thank [dark-mode-notify](https://github.com/bouk/dark-mode-notify/tree/4d7fe211f81c5b67402fad4bed44995344a260d1) without which I would not have been able to develop the theme change so responsive.
